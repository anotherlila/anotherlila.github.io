        <p> You can modify this recipe for diatary ristrctions as needed. For example I am going to modify the recipe to be gluten free for my family member. So I will use gluten free oats, vinnila and peanutbutter. You can use normal ingredents as you wish and it should not impact the taste. The pictures are when me and my sister made a video about making No Bake Cookies 3 years ago. it was made with an ipad so the quality is bad.  </p>
